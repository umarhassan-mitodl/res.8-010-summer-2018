  caption: "In (non-relativistic) thermodynamics, a closed system is like a greenhouse\
    \ with a closed door. Light (i.e., energy) can enter and leave, but people (i.e.,\
    \ matter) cannot. Open systems allow both energy and matter to enter and leave,\
    \ whereas\_isolated systems (such as our universe) are impermeable to matter and\
    \ energy. (Image courtesy of Dr. Mobolaji Williams.)"
